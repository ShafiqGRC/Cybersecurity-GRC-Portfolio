# Governance & Risk Management

## Overview
Governance and Risk Management establish the foundation of an organization's cybersecurity posture by defining roles, responsibilities, processes, and controls to manage risks effectively.

## Key Components
- Establishing cybersecurity governance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST CSF)
- Defining organizational roles & responsibilities for security
- Risk management lifecycle: identification, analysis, mitigation, monitoring
- Continuous improvement via audits and reviews

## Example Work
- Developed a governance framework aligned with ISO 27001 for a mid-sized company.
- Implemented risk registers and tracked remediation plans.
- Conducted quarterly risk reviews with cross-functional teams.

## Tools & Frameworks
- Risk Management Tools: RiskWatch, Archer, LogicManager
- Frameworks: NIST CSF
